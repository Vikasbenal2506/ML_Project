# 📘 Student Performance Predictor – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts student academic performance based on demographic, behavioural, and academic features.
This project follows a production-style ML pipeline inspired by Krish Naik’s architecture and includes full deployment using Flask and Hugging Face Spaces.
